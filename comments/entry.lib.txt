1. the values from the form will be placed (for delivery) into the $_POST super-global array. it is an associative array. So HEAN (Html Element's Attribute Name) will be the array's key. HEAV (Html Element's Attribute Value) will be the array's value
2. if we have an id delivered here by GET, then we know the user is updating the entry
3. instantiate entry manager
4. the values of the `value` attribute are based on `tbl_language`
5. When the submit button is pressed $_POST super-global array is filled with values in this format: each HEAN becomes the AE key, each HEAV becomes the AE value. if the $_POST is read in the same page the values will be taken by the same page again
